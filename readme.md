The International Data Base (IDB) of the U.S. Census Bureau contains various demographic data (currently from 1950 to 2100) on all states and regions of our world that are recognized by the US Department of State and have a population of 5,000 or more. The sources of the database are information from state institutions, such as censuses, surveys, or administrative records, as well as estimates and projections by the U.S. Census Bureau itself.

The dataset in the file census2001_2021.csv contains a small extract from the IDB. It includes life expectancy at birth and total infant mortality rates for 227 countries from 2001 and 2021. For the exact definitions of these variables see https://www.census.gov/ programs-surveys/international-programs/about/glossary.html. Life expectancy is stratified by sex. The countries are divided geographically into 5 regions and 21 subregions.
